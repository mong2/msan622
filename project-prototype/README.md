So far I have been pretty on track on what I plan to make. 
In case that you haven't read the project sketch of mine, I'm using a baseball data and will focus on 2000-2013

For what I have now is the interactive part of my first tab. 
This tab allows people to see how each team perform during the time period. The bottom panel is the winning percentage of the team and the viewer can play with other factors through sidebar to plot the upper graph. 
For my second tab which is not created will be focsuing on players instead of teams. As for the last tab, the viewer will be able to create a team base on the information they have from the previous two tabs
